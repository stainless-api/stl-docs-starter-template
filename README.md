# Getting started

The Stainless Docs Platform is built on top of [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build). Starlight is a powerful documentation framework designed for speed, accessibility, and customizability.

This project is a standard Starlight project with the `stl-starlight` plugin pre-configured.

To get up and running quickly, use our [quickstart guide](https://stainless.com/docs/docs-platform/quickstart/).
