import { Callout, Accordion } from "@stainless-api/docs/components";

Welcome to your <strong>Stainless Docs</strong> site! Your site has a few example pages pre-built, but everything in your site is configurable. In addition to auto-generated API and SDK reference pages, you can add custom prose pages like the one you're reading now.

## Built-in components

Stainless components are available as imports from `@stainless-api/docs/components`. Here are a few examples along with code samples showing how to use them:

### Callout

```mdx
import { Callout } from "@stainless-api/docs/components";

<Callout variant="info">This is an info callout.</Callout>
```

<Callout variant="note">This is a note callout.</Callout>

### Accordion

```mdx
import { Accordion } from "@stainless-api/docs/components";

<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Summary>Example Accordion</Accordion.Summary>
  This is some example content inside the details element. It is hidden by
  default and will be shown when the summary is clicked.
</Accordion>
```
